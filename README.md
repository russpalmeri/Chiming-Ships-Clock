# Chiming-Ships-Clock
Project to have an analog brass ship's clock that uses bells to indicate watches. 
I'd like to shown the clock running continuously, and ringing the time using the watch system below.
The naval day started at noon. Each watch was four hours. 
The afternoon watch 'The dog watch' of only two hours allowed for rotation of the shifts.
